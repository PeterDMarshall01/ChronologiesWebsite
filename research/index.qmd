### How to use


The map provides a spatial overview of some of the sites sites & projects we have been fortunate to have worked on.

-   **Basic Navigation:** Use the **+ and - buttons** (top left) to zoom in and out of the map 
**Click and drag** to pan around different geographic areas

-   **Finding Sites:** **Markers** indicate  sites or project we have been involved with. **Click on any marker** for links to further information
