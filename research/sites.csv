A twelve-week excavation was undertaken resulting in the recording of possible causeway structures found buried within peat and alluvial silts and sands.,Anglo-Saxon,"Dendrochronology, Radiocarbon"
Barrow Clump,-1.764404,51.221059,https://wessexarchaeologylibrary.org/plugins/books/51/,"Barrow Clump is located on the Salisbury Plain Training Area, within Figheldean parish, approximately 6km north-east of Stonehenge. The excavated cemetery features included 70 inhumation graves and one possible cremation-related deposit. The majority of graves cut into the natural geology, or in the remaining cases, into the upper fills of the early Bronze Age barrow ditch.",Multi-period,Radiocarbon
