title: "Radiocarbon dating of lipids preserved in pottery vessels: guidelines for best-practice in compound-specific ^14^C analyses"
description: "Accurate radiocarbon dating of archaeological pottery vessels by isolating reliable sources of carbon relating to the use of pots has long been a major challenge, but is now possible using compound-specific radiocarbon analysis of absorbed organic residues preserved in the ceramic fabric of the vessel wall. These guidelines describe best-practice in compound-specific ^14^C analyses"
